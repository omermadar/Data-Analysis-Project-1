# Python Statistical Functions (Homework 1)

This project is a Python script that performs several basic statistical and mathematical operations on a list of numbers. It's designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts and data manipulation.

## Features

The script initializes a list of 100 random integers and then calculates the following metrics:

* **Median**: The middle value of the dataset.
* **Sample Standard Deviation**: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of the set of values.
* **Alternating Sum**: The sum of the list's elements with alternating signs (e.g., `item1 - item2 + item3 - ...`).

Finally, it shuffles the list and recalculates some metrics to demonstrate the use of function arguments. The results are saved to an `output.json` file.
